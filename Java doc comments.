/**
 * This method calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer.
 * The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number.

 *
 * @param n The number for which the factorial is to be calculated. It must be a non-negative integer.
 * @return The factorial of the given number. If the input is 0, the method returns 1.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException If the input number is negative.
